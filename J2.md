# J2
## 1. String s is an object.
## 2. 
A. A static method can be called with its class name. 
B. The main method needs to be a static method because 
## 3. 
Program 1: wrong because == compares memory addresses of objects
program 2: correct because it's entering the address and compares the character
## 4. It does not change the season because it calls on the change_season method using the memory address of the season but only changes the address of str. 
## 5. X: 0 Y: 0 because the point method does not change the original memory address of x and y.
## 6. The private declaration limits the visibility of variables and functions, maintaining the principle of information hiding.
## 7. Java chooses between the two constructors using their arguments.
## 8. option 4
- The point of inheritance is code reuse
- option 1 is out because x & y are private
- option 2 is out because x & y are private
- option 3 is not allowed
- option 4 declares a new x and y and calls a public function so it works
- option 5 does not declare x & y so it is wrong
## 9. x: 10 y: 10
- if you want to call super it has to be their first line, otherwise it will not compile
## 10.  x: 0 y: 0
## 11. option 2
- option 1 does not work because x and y are private
- option 2 works
- option 3 does not work 
- option 4 does not work
## 12. The protected modifier allows a field to be accessible inside the class and any derived classes.
## 13. 
public class FormulaOne extends Racecar {
    private String make;

    public FormulaOne(int n, Driver d, String make) {
        super(n,d);
        this.make = make;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return supert.toString() + " " + make;
    }
}
## 14. Neither A or B will work because it is called outside the inheritance key.
